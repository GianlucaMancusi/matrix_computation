This C library is designed to **perform calculations on matrix**.
Here are some of the cool features:

 * **Determinant** of a square matrix (Laplace's method)
 * Possibility to reduce a matrix in **rowEchelonForm**
 * In-situ **matrix transposition** (uses a lightweight auxiliary table to perform it on rectangular matricies)
 * Fast matrix row edits (matricies are stored by rows)
 * Matrix multiplication
